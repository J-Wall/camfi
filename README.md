# Image annotation

## Performing the annotations in VIA

1. Open “via.html”.

2. In the top menu, click on Project, then choose Load (see the red oval to the
   left in @fig:navigating_via). Find your VIA project file, and click Open.

   ![Loading project and navigating through
   images](manual_figures/navigating_via.png){#fig:navigating_via.png}

3. If it is the first time that you work on the file, simply start with the
   first image. If you have already worked on the project file before and you
   have a saved version, scroll down to the last image that you were working on
   and click on it. You can now start working from that image.

4. You move between images (backwards and forwards) with the sideways arrows in
   the top menu (see the blue oval to the right in Fig.1), or you can use the
   sideways arrows on your keyboard.

5. To zoom in and out, use the magnifying glass (+ or -, see the yellow oval in
   the upper right corner in Fig.1).

6. To the left, you can find different Region shapes (see the red oval in
   Fig.2). The only ones I have been using are the “Circular region shape”, the
   “Point region shape”, and the “Polyline region shape”.
   a. Circular region
      shape: This shape can be used when you cannot see the whole moth (or the
      whole motion blur), e.g., when the moth is going out the edge of the image
      (see the moth in the upper right corner in Fig.3), if another moth or object
      is covering it, or if you find it hard to see where the motion blur starts
      and ends. To draw a circle region, simply press single click and drag the
      mouse.
