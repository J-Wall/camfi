Introduction
============

Camfi is a method
for the long-term non-invasive monitoring
of the activity
and abundance
of low-flying insects
using inexpensive wildlife cameras.
It provides utilities
for measuring
the wingbeat frequency
of insects
in still images,
based on the motion blurs
drawn on the image sensor
by the insect
moving through the air.
For large-scale monitoring projects,
camfi enables
automatic annotation
of flying insects
using the Mask R-CNN framework.

Camfi is implemented
as a Python library,
and it also
comes with a simple,
yet comprehensive
:doc:`usage/cli`.
