Welcome to Camfi's documentation!
=================================

Camfi is a method for the long-term non-invasive monitoring of the activity and
abundance of low-flying insects using inexpensive wildlife cameras. It provides
utilities for measuring the wingbeat frequency of insects in still images,
based on the motion blurs drawn on the image sensor by the insect moving
through the air. For large-scale monitoring projects, camfi enables automatic
annotation of flying insects using the Mask R-CNN framework.

The accompanying paper for camfi is currently under preparation.
