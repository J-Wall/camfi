SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    Filters VIA annotations by enforcing a minimum and/or maximum value
    for a numerical region attribute (eg. "score" which is defined during
    automatic automatic annotation)

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    BY
        Type: str
        The region_attributes key to filter annotations by.

FLAGS
    --minimum=MINIMUM
        Type: float
        Default: -inf
        The minimum value of the region attribute to pass the filter
    --maximum=MAXIMUM
        Type: float
        Default: inf
        The maximum value of the region attribute to pass the filter
    --mode=MODE
        Type: str
        Default: 'warn'
        One of {"pass", "fail", "raise", "warn"}. Defines how annotations
        missing the `by` region attribute are handled. "pass": These
        annotations pass the filter. "fail": These annotations are
        removed. "raise": A KeyError is raised if an annotation is missing
        the attribute. "warn": Like "pass" but a warning is printed to
        sys.stderr.

NOTES
    You can also use flags syntax for POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
