NAME
    camfi validate_annotations - Compares annotation file against a
    ground-truth annotation file for automatic annotation validation
    puposes.

SYNOPSIS
    camfi validate_annotations GROUND_TRUTH <flags>

DESCRIPTION
    Validation data is output to a json dict, which includes:

    all_ious: list of [iou, score] pairs
        iou is the Intersection over Union of the bounding boxes of true
        positives
        to their matched ground truth annotation. All matched annotations
        are
        included.
        score is the prediction score of the automatic annotation
    polyline_hausdorff_distances: list of [h_dist, score] pairs
        h_dist is the hausdorff distance of a true positive polyline
        annotation,
        where the annotation is matched to a polyline ground truth
        annotation. Only
        polyline annotations which matched to a polyline ground truth
        annotation are
        included.
        score is the prediction score of the automatic annotation
    length_differences: list of [l_diff, score] pairs
        l_diff is calculated as the length of a true positive polyline
        annotation
        minus the length of it's matched ground truth annotation. Only
        polyline
        annotations which matched to a polyline ground truth annotation
        are
        included.
        score is the prediction score of the automatic annotation
    true_positives: list of scores
        score is the prediction score of the automatic annotation
    false_positives: list of scores
        score is the prediction score of the automatic annotation
    false_negatives: int
        number of false negative annotations

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    GROUND_TRUTH
        Type: str
        Path to ground truth VIA annotations file. Should contain
        annotations for all images in input annotation file.

FLAGS
    --iou_thresh=IOU_THRESH
        Type: float
        Default: 0.5
        Threshold of intersection-over-union of bounding boxes to be
        considered a match.

NOTES
    You can also use flags syntax for POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
