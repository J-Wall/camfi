NAME
    camfi merge_annotations - Takes a list of VIA project files and merges
    them into one. Ignores --i in favour of annotation_files.

SYNOPSIS
    camfi merge_annotations <flags> [ANNOTATION_FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
    Takes a list of VIA project files and merges them into one. Ignores
    --i in favour of annotation_files.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    ANNOTATION_FILES
        Type: str
        list of VIA project json files to merge. Project and VIA settings
        are taken from the first file.

FLAGS
    --preserve_all_regions=PRESERVE_ALL_REGIONS
        Type: bool
        If True, instead of overwriting all annotations for duplicate
        images (default behaviour), regions are appended to each images'
        annotations. The default behaviour is somewhat faster than the
        preserving behaviour, so only use if necessary.
